My name is Ilya (eel-ya), and this is my home page. If you are reading this, one of the following is probably true:

* You are one of my friends, and are checking up on me via Google
* You are a recruiter who found my resume in your pile and decided to follow the link

If it's the latter, you are in luck, because I wrote this webpage for you! Here you 
will find concrete evidence of my work so you can
decide whether you want to move forward with a screen/interivew. So, see below:

_Comparative sequence analysis of functional RNAs_

In all living cells we have these things called Ribonucleic Acids (RNAs). Most of the them are
inert templates that carry information from DNA to proteins (see [Central Dogma](wikipedia.com)).
Some RNAs, however, are actively functional - just like proteins, they are catalytic and
can do useful work within the cell. I helped develop a method that scans the evolutionary
history of these molecules and predicts their most important nucleotides.

_Analysis of 120 million records shows patterns of player behavior in World of Warcraft_

Blizzard, the operator of _World of Warcraft_ game,
provides troves of data on their player behavior. I was curious to see if I can find any
patterns in that behavior. So I wrote a pipeline that continuously scans Blizzard's API for data, stores it in the cloud, and
displays the results as a dashboard.

The subject matter (gaming) is somewhat frivolous; the fun/key part was dealing
with large amounts of data (~300 million rows). This project taught me RDBMS/SQL + the basics of deploying on AWS.
