My name is Ilya (eel-ya), and this is my home page. If you are reading this, one of the following is probably true:

* You are one of my friends, and are checking up on me via Google
* You are a recruiter who found my resume in your pile and decided to follow the link

If it's the latter, you are in luck, because I wrote this webpage for you! Here you 
will find concrete evidence of my work so you can
decide whether you want to move forward with a screen/interivew. So, see below:


#### Examples of Work
----
_Comparative sequence analysis of functional RNAs_

In all living cells we have these things called Ribonucleic Acids (RNAs). Most of the them are
inert templates that carry information from DNA to proteins (see [Central Dogma](wikipedia.com)).
Some RNAs, however, are actively functional - just like proteins, they are catalytic and
can do useful work within the cell. I helped develop a method that scans the evolutionary
history of these molecules and predicts their most important nucleotides.

_Predicting global spread of COVID via graph diffusion_

Inspired by recent events. This is an application of the same graph learning approach
that I described above. Here, instead of proteins, world nations are the nodes, and
labels are the virus. Given initial site of
infection, this model predicts where the virus will spread next.

The accuracy isn't that great. Key takeaway for me was that network models that are based
on movement of people (eg: international travel, tourism)  work a lot better at predicting the spread of the virus than 
network models based on other information (ex: geographical proximity, amount of bilateral trade, etc).

_Analysis of 120 million records shows patterns of player behavior in World of Warcraft_

Blizzard, the operator of _World of Warcraft_ game,
provides troves of data on their player behavior. I was curious to see if I can find any
patterns in that behavior. So I wrote a pipeline that continuously scans Blizzard's API for data, stores it in the cloud, and
displays the results as a dashboard.

 The subject matter (gaming) is somewhat frivolous; the fun/key part was dealing
 with large amounts of data (~300 million rows). This project taught me RDBMS/SQL + the basics of deploying on AWS.

#### Skills
The projects above were really meant to convey just 2 points:

* I am good at taking open-ended questions, reducing them to testable hypotheses, and delivering end-to-end analysis and tools
* I have a good technical toolkit: I know Python/SQL, I understand basic statistics&ML, I am good at data viz, I am comfortable with working in the cloud. I try my best to write readable code :)

So if you think I can help you get some work done, get in touch.

Thank you!
