I am an aspiring Data Scientist based in the Greater Houston area. For a formal resume,
please see [this PDF](coming_soon-tm). For an informal overview of my career trajectory, read on.

As a high schooler, I developed a strong interest in the scientific method and basic science.
Acting on it, I enrolled at the 
Texas A&M University in College Station, and pursued a degree in biochemistry.
Through my undergrad, I tried to apply classroom theory in practice, working
both as an analytical chemist (spectophotometry) and a biochemistry technician (HPLC).

After graduating with a Biochemistry BS in 2010, I went to the Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston, where I enrolled in the PhD program, also in Biochemistry. As I progressed with
my studies, I became interested in programming and using computers to solve biological problems.
I followed this interest and joined a computational biology lab, where I worked on evolutionary biology of
RNA, and on graph learning via biological networks. Both of these projects are detailed
on my home page. During this time I learned the basics of programming, statistics,
and machine learning, as well as developed a strong foundation for working with ambiguous, real-world data.

It took me a while to wrap up my studies at Baylor, and I graduated in 2019.
Immediately following that, I did a summer internship as a Data Science Fellow at the 
Mercury Data Science consultancy in Houston. There I worked with real customer data doing
A/B testing, customer cohort classification, and churn modeling.

After my summer at Mercury, I took time off through the 2020 COVID pandemic. During
the pandemic sabbatical I went into self-study and learned industry-standard languages
and practices (eg I transitioned to Python from MATLAB, learned to work on the cloud and
use version control, etc).

I am now looking to continue my professional journey, looking for opportunities
in the data space.
